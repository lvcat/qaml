<blockquote>
<p>One day, Plato asked Socrates: what is love? Socrates said: I ask you to cross this piece of rice fields, to pick one of the largest and most golden wheat back, but there is a rule: you can not go back, and you can only pick once. So Plato went on. After a long time, he was back with empty hand. Socrates ask him why come back with empty? Plato said: When I walked in the field, I had seen a few particularly special bright wheat, but I always think there may be bigger and better in front, so there is no pick; but when I continue walking, see the wheat, always feel it is not better than the previous which i had seen, so I did not pick anything finally. Socrates said meaningfully: this is love.</p>
