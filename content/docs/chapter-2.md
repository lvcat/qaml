# Chapter II Machine Learning Fundamentals

In this chapter, we will discuss some *basic knowledge about machine learning*

###  What is regression? What is classification?

Regression is about predicting a label and classification is about predicting a quantity. In other word, the result of regression are continous quantities while the result of classification are discrete class labels.

For example, if

###  What are the steps for a supervised learning?

###  What is multi instance learning?

###  What is K-Nearest-Neighbor or KNN? What is SVM?  

###  What is neural network? What are the types of difference neural networks?

###  What is local optimum? What is global optimum?

> One day, Plato asked Socrates: what is love? Socrates said: I ask you to cross this piece of rice fields, to pick one of the largest and most golden wheat back, but there is a rule: you can not go back, and you can only pick once. So Plato went on. After a long time, he was back with empty hand. Socrates ask him why come back with empty? Plato said: When I walked in the field, I had seen a few particularly special bright wheat, but I always think there may be bigger and better in front, so there is no pick; but when I continue walking, see the wheat, always feel it is not better than the previous which i had seen, so I did not pick anything finally. Socrates said meaningfully: this is love.

###  What are the advantages and disadvantages of common classification algorithms, such as Bayes, Decision Tree or SVM?

###  Can the accuracy be a great and comprehensive measurement for classification?

###  If not, what are the measurements for classification algorithm? and what are for regression algorithm?

###  What is a good enough classification algorithm?

###  What is logistic regression? What is Poisson regression?

###  What are the differences between logistic regression and naïve bayes?

###  What are the differences between linear regression and logistic regression?

A: Linear Regression: \\(f(x)=\theta ^{T}x=\theta _{1}x _{1}+\theta _{2}x _{2}+...+\theta _{n}x _{n}\\)

Logistic Regression: \\(f(x)=P(y=1|x;\theta )=g(\theta ^{T}x)\\)，where，\\(g(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\\)

###  What is cost function? Why we need it?

###  Why cost function can work?

###  Why cost function have to have a lower bound? or why most cost functions cannot be minus?

###  What are some common cost function?

###  Why we use cross entropy to replace quadratic cost?

###  What is loss function? Why we need it?

###  What are some common loss function?

###  Why we use log loss function in logistic regression?

###  How log loss function measures the loss?

###  What is gradient decent? why we need it?

###  What are the advantages and drawbacks of gradient decent?

###  Still unclear, is there any graph or description?

###  What are the steps of gradient decent?

###  What are the steps of LDA?

###  What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis)? and its steps?

###  What are the differences between LDA and PCA?

###  What are the advantages and drawbacks of LDA and PCA?
