# Q-As about Machine Learning

## Inspiration

This book is inspired by a Chinese book named [Deep Learning-500-Questions](https://github.com/scutan90/DeepLearning-500-questions). After read the book, I found it really useful in the process of learning, therefore, I decided to spread it to more readers by writing a English version. When I was writing this book, I will try to re-organize questions in the original book, add more questions and answer the questions in my own way. I do believe that, only translation of original version cannot satisfy readers and I would compile all the contents by myself and co-writers.
